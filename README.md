TCUP Edge: A lightweight, microservices-based IoT platform, designed to run on resource-constrained devices with low CPU
and memory footprint.
• Developed a utility program that collects resource usage and performance characteristics of a device and applications using
GoLang. Provides a control layer over the applications, including start, stop and disable.
• Developed a web application that simplifies interface for managing configurations and rules of edge computation and data
storage, health monitoring of system and services, and remote shell access.
• Containerized different applications written in several languages using docker and provided support for deployment of the
platform in embedded devices, such as Nvidia Jetson board series, Raspberry Pi.
• Provided support for deployment of the platform in embedded devices, such as Nvidia Jetson board series, Raspberry Pi.
FUSION: A persona-based cloud application suite for rapidly realizing IoT driven implementation of industrial internet use-
cases based on data harvested from assets/equipment.
• Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) authorization.
• Developed user interface screens that provide access to configuration settings, health monitoring, control, and status check
of Edge devices running across various networks and locations.
• Implemented an architecture to support Edge and Cloud Integration: a back-end server exposing APIs for remote access and
actuation, and a persistent connection for near real time health monitoring.
• Automated build process using Jenkins facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.
